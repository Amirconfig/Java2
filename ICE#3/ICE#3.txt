Modify the Course class of ICE#10.6 the modified class is called CourseNew.
The modifications are as follows: 

1. Modify the getStudents() method to return an array whose length is the same as the number of
students in the course. (HINT: create a new array and copy array students to it.)

2. The array size is fixed in ICE# 10.6. Modify the addStudent method to automatically increase the 
array size if there is no room to add more students. (HINT: This is done by creating a new larger 
array and copying the contents of the current array to it.)

3. Implement the dropStudent method.

4. Add a new method named clear() that removes all students from the course.
